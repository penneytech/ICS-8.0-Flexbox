Today you'll learn to use some flexboxes!

********* NOTE: Today you are basically recreating the steps on the 8.0 powerpoint. If you follow that powerpoint and create the product shown on it, you'll be good. **********

Create a webpage with the following properties: 

1) One parent <div> with three children <div> items inside. Choose a flex-direction (row or column). 

2) Set one of the childen to a static height (or width, depending on the flex-direction you chose). The other two children should have a flex ratio set.

3) Choose one of the children <div> from step 1 and create two children <div> within it. Set the flex direction to whichever direction you did not use in step 1 (row or column).

4) Add a margin to the new childen you created - this will make a "card" effect within the parent div.

5) Go to https://coolors.co/ and generate a color scheme. Set the background color of each <div> in your project (should be 5) to one of the colors. 

6) If you have extra time, play around with styling, add some content, and explore.
